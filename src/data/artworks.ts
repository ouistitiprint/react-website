    description: "Kobe Bryant was like a superhero to me. His skills, his words of wisdom, and how he touched the souls of millions was very appreciated. He was like family to everyone he met and when he died, he took part of the goodness of the world with him. Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash on Jan. 26, 2020. He was 41. Also killed in the crash was Bryant's 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven others who were on board the aircraft. Bryant became one of the NBA's most popular players and the face of the Lakers during his career. Kobe was an 18-time All-Star champion who won five NBA championships, 4 NBA All-Star Game MVP awards and became one of the greatest basketball players of his generation during a 20-year career with the Lakers. He was the overall league MVP in 2008, a two-time NBA scoring champion and 12 All-Defensive selections. Kobe Bryant was a legend and will be greatly missed by millions of people around the world. As Kobe once said. â€œThe most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do.",

export const oluwaytoyinSalau: IArtworksData = {
    name: "Oluwaytoyin Salau",
    description: "Oluwatoyin \"Toyin\" Ruth Salau was a 19-year-old woman who disappeared on Saturday, June 6, 2020, shortly after tweeting about recently being sexually assaulted. Toyin was at a Black Lives Matter protest in Tallahassee, Florida. She did not have a stable home, so she asked around seeking shelter after the protest. Salau was found dead on Saturday, June 13, 2020, and her death was confirmed on Monday, June 15, 2020. Toyin and I were fighting for the same reasons. We were both fighting for the equality and justice of African-Americans in the United States of America. Shortly after hearing about her death and learning that the murderer was no other than, an older African-American man was very disheartening. I felt angry for Toyin and every other victim of sexual assault, such as myself. African-American women are more likely to be raped by men than any other race in this country and it should not be that way. No woman or man, regardless of ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, etc. deserves to be traumatized over the sick obsession of the rape culture. To conclude, I pledged to myself that I will fight for what I believe is right. I will fight for the justice for Oluwatoyin Salau, Rayshard Brooks, Breonna Taylor and many other African-Americans who were brutally murdered by the police and many other racist citizens of America.",
